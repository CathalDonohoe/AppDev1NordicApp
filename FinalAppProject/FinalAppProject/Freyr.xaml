                               &#10; of peace and fertility, rain, and sunshine and the son of the sea god Njörd. 
                               &#10; Although originally one of the Vanir tribe, he was included with the Aesir. Gerd, 
                               &#10; daughter of the giant Gymir, was his wife. Worshiped especially in Sweden, he was 
                               &#10; also well-known in Norway and Iceland. His sister and female counterpart, Freya, 
                               &#10; was goddess of love, fertility, battle, and death. The boar was sacred to both. 
                               &#10; Freyr and Freya figure in many lays and stories of medieval Iceland."
