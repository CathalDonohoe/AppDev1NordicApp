                    <Label Text="Freyr, also spelled Frey, also called Yngvi, in Norse mythology, the ruler 
                               &#10; of peace and fertility, rain, and sunshine and the son of the sea god Njörd. 
                               &#10; Although originally one of the Vanir tribe, he was included with the Aesir. Gerd, 
                               &#10; daughter of the giant Gymir, was his wife. Worshiped especially in Sweden, he was 
                               &#10; also well-known in Norway and Iceland. His sister and female counterpart, Freya, 
                               &#10; was goddess of love, fertility, battle, and death. The boar was sacred to both. 
                               &#10; Freyr and Freya figure in many lays and stories of medieval Iceland."

                    <Label Text="As such, it makes sense that Freyr is known as a god of fertility and peace. He is also strongly associated
                           &#10; with the sun, which gives us a good idea of his importance. Across many cultures, sun gods tend to be at, or 
                           &#10; close to, the top of their respective pantheons. Freyr is described in old poems as being first among the gods 
                           &#10; when it came to reputation. Apparently, no one disliked him among all the people."

                    <Label Text="Freyr is usually depicted as a virile, muscular man with long flowing hair. Often, he is carrying a sword and 
                           &#10; he is almost always accompanied by his gigantic golden-bristled boar, Gullinbursti. Since Freyr is both the son 
                           &#10; of the ocean god and himself the sun god, we can see both of those themes in artwork that depicts him. Some images 
                           &#10; will show him holding an antler, since in one of his myths he is forced to give his sword away and must make do with an antler instead."
