                    <Label Text="The original Germanic god of war and the patron god of justice, the precursor of Odin. At the time of the Vikings, Tyr had to 
                           &#10; make way for Odin, who became the god of war himself. Tyr was by then regarded as Odin's son (or possibly of the giant Hymir). 
                           &#10; He is the boldest of the gods, who inspires courage and heroism in battle. Tyr is represented as a man with one hand, because 
                           &#10; his right hand was bitten off by the gigantic wolf Fenrir (in old-Norse, the wrist was called 'wolf-joint'). His attribute is a
                           &#10; spear; the symbol of justice, as well as a weapon. At the day of Ragnarok, Tyr will kill the hound Garm, the guardian of the hell, 
                           &#10; but will die from the wounds inflicted by the animal. In later mythology, 'Tyr' became to mean 'god'. He is also known as T'waz, Tiw and Ziu."
