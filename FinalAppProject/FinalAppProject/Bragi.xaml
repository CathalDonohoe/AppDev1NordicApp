                               &#10; in Norse mythology. He is regarded as a son of Odin and Frigg. Runes 
                                &#10; were carved on his tongue and he inspired poetry in humans by letting 
                                &#10; them drink from the mead of poetry. Bragi is married to Idun, the goddess 
                                &#10; of eternal youth. Oaths were sworn over the Bragarfull ('Cup of Bragi') 
                                &#10; and drinks were taken from it in honor of a dead king. Before a king ascended
                                &#10; the throne, he drank from such a cup."
