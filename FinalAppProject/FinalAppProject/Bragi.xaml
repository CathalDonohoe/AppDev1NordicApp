                                &#10; were carved on his tongue and he inspired poetry in humans by letting 
                                &#10; them drink from the mead of poetry. Oaths were sworn over the Bragarfull ('Cup of Bragi') 
                                &#10; and drinks were taken from it in honor of a dead king. Before a king ascended
                                &#10; the throne, he drank from such a cup."

                           &#10; out of selfish reasons though. Odin wants the 'Mead of Poetry', which is guarded by the giant Suttung and his
                           &#10; daughter Gunnlod. They keep the Mead in a cave, but Odin manages to get into the cave somehow, disguised as a 
                           &#10; snake. He presents himself to Gunnlod as a handsome lover and drinks all the Mead while staying with her for three 
                           &#10; nights. The product of these three nights of love is Bragi, who is sent to live with his father and due to the Mead
