                               &#10; beautiful and propitious of the goddesses. She is the patron goddess of crops
                               &#10; and birth, the symbol of sensuality and was called upon in matters of love. She 
                               &#10; loves music, spring and flowers, and is particularly fond of the elves (fairies). 
                               &#10; Freya is one of the foremost goddesses of the Vanir.

                               &#10; Goddess of sex, battle, and pleasure, most beautiful and desirable of white-armed women,
                               &#10; Freyja was sister to the male fertility god Freyr. Freyja had unusual parity with Odin, 
                               &#10; for they divided the heroic dead amongst themselves. Half went to live eternally in Odin's 
                               &#10; hall, and half in Freyja's hall Sessrumnir- and the goddess got first pick."
