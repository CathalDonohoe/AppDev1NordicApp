                           &#10; She is the patron of marriage and motherhood, and the goddess of love and fertility. 
                           &#10; In that aspect she shows many similarities with Freya, of whom she possibly is a different form.
                           &#10; 
                           &#10; She has a reputation of knowing every person's destiny, but never unveils it. As the mother of Balder,
                           &#10; she tried to prevent his death by extracting oaths from every object in nature, but forgot the mistletoe. 
                           &#10; And by a fig made from mistletoe Balder died.
                           &#10; 
                           &#10; As Woden/Odin gave his name to Wednesday, and Thunor/Thor to Thursday, so Frigg is remembered in Friday. 
                           &#10; Frigg was the direct daughter of Fjorgyn, the Goddess of Earth. She kept her own hall, called Fensalir. 
                           &#10; Women prayed to her for children and prayed again for safe labor and delivery."
