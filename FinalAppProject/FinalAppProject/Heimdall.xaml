                    <Label Text=" Heimdall is the god of light, the son of nine mothers (variously given as the daughters of Geirrendour the Giant or of Aegir).
                           &#10; He was born at the end of the world and raised by the force of the earth, seawater and the blood of a boar.
                           &#10; Because of his shining, golden teeth he is also called Gullintani ('gold tooth').
                           &#10; His hall is Himinbjorg, The Cliffs of Heaven, and his horse is Gulltop. Heimdall carries the horn Gjallar.
                           &#10; He is the watchman of the gods and guards Bifrost, the only entrance to Asgard, the realm of the gods.
                           &#10; It is Heimdall's duty to prevent the giants from forcing their way into Asgard. He requires less sleep than a
                           &#10; bird and can see a hundred miles around him, by night as well as by day. His hearing is so accurate that no sound 
                           &#10; escapes him: he can even hear the grass grow or the wool on a sheep's back. At the final conflict of Ragnarok he will 
                           &#10; kill his age-old enemy, the evil god Loki, but will die himself from his wounds. As the god Rig ('ruler'), Heimdall created 
                           &#10; the three races of mankind: the serfs, the peasants, and the warriors. It is interesting to note why Heimdall fathered them, 
                           &#10; and not Odin as might be expected. Furthermore, Heimdall is in many attributes identical with Tyr."
