                    <Label Text="The most unpredictable and certainly the most dangerous god in the Northern pantheon was Loki. His
                           &#10; activities ran from the merely mischievous to the blatantly malicious. Supremely clever, Loki ensnared 
                           &#10; everyone in complicated problems, to which he always supplied a remedy - through his solution often engendered
                           &#10; even greater troubles. His parents were both giants (the perpetual enemies of the gods.)
                           &#10; Loki is an immensely powerful magician, and shares with Odin the ability to sex and shape shift at will. Loki was 
                           &#10; fair of face, and took many lovers, despite his constant criticism of goddesses who did the same. His wife is Sigyn, 
                           &#10; who stayed loyal to him, even when the gods punished him for the death of Balder. Loki's mistress is the giantess Angrboda. 
                           &#10; With her he is the father of three monsters. He had some unusual children, including the huge wolf borne from Loki's brief 
                           &#10; dalliance with a giantess. Loki was the father (and in few instances the mother) of many creatures, men and monsters. Having 
                           &#10; liaisons with giantesses was nothing unusual for gods in Norse mythology - both Odin and Freyr are good examples; and since 
                           &#10; Loki was actually a giant himself, there is nothing unusual about this activity. It is Loki who begins the chain of events 
                           &#10; that leads to the destruction of the gods. He does this by causing the death of the beautiful Baldr, Frigg's son, who in his 
                           &#10; goodness and perfection embodies the attainment of every desirable quality. Baldr's death plunges all of Asgard into mourning. 
                           &#10; Yet Loki feels no remorse, and in fact relishes every opportunity to exert his contrary nature. Loki was chained to three large
                           &#10; boulders; one under his shoulders, one under his loins and one under his knees. A poisonous snake was placed above his head. 
                           &#10; The dripping venom that lands on him is caught by Sigyn in a bowl. But every now and then, when the bowl is filled to the brim,
                           &#10; she has to leave him to empty it. Then the poison that falls on Loki's face makes him twist in pain, causing earthquakes. After
                           &#10; Frigg had gone to great lengths to bring Baldr back to the land of the living by asking all beings to weep for his return, Loki 
                           &#10; (in the guise of an old female giant) steadfastly refused to shed a single tear for the slain god. Thus Baldr was consigned to the
                           &#10; realms of the dead, under the governance of Lady Hel. "
