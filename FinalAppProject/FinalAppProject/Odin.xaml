                           &#10; are difficult to determine because of the complex picture of him given by the wealth of archaeological and literary sources. 
                           &#10; The Roman historian Tacitus stated that the Teutons worshiped Mercury; and because dies Mercurii ('Mercury's day') was identified 
                           &#10; with Wednesday ('Woden's day'), there is little doubt that the god Woden (the earlier form of Odin) was meant. Though Woden was
                           &#10; worshiped preeminently, there is not sufficient evidence of his cult to show whether it was practiced by all the Teutonic tribes or
                           &#10; to enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of the god. Later literary sources, however, indicate that at the end of the pre-Christian
                           &#10; period Odin was the principal god in Scandinavia.
                           &#10; 
                           &#10; From earliest times Odin was a war god, and he appeared in heroic literature as the protector of heroes; fallen warriors joined
                           &#10; him in Valhalla. The wolf and the raven were dedicated to him. His magical horse, Sleipnir, had eight legs, teeth inscribed with runes, 
                           &#10; and the ability to gallop through the air and over the sea. Odin was the great magician among the gods and was associated with runes. He was 
                           &#10; also the god of poets. In outward appearance he was a tall, old man, with flowing beard and only one eye (the other he gave in exchange for
                           &#10; wisdom). He was usually depicted wearing a cloak and a wide-brimmed hat and carrying a spear."
