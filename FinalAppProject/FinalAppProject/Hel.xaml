                           &#10; to Helheim/Niflheim to preside over the spirits of the dead, except for those who were killed
                           &#10; in battle and went to Valhalla. It was her job to determine the fate of the souls who entered her realm.
                           &#10; Hel is often depicted with her bones on the outside of her body rather than the inside. She is typically 
                           &#10; portrayed in black and white, as well, showing that she represents both sides of all spectrums."
