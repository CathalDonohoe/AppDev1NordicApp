            <Label Text="Ragnarok is the cataclysmic destruction of the cosmos and everything in it – even the gods. When Norse mythology is considered 
                   &#10; as a chronological set of tales, the story of Ragnarok naturally comes at the very end. For the Vikings, the myth of Ragnarok
                   &#10; was a prophecy of what was to come at some unspecified and unknown time in the future, but it had profound ramifications for 
                   &#10; how the Vikings understood the world in their own time. We'll explore some of those ramifications below.
                   &#10;
                   &#10; The word 'Ragnarok' comes from Old Norse Ragnarök, 'Fate of the Gods.' In an apparent play on words, some pieces of Old Norse 
                   &#10; literature also refer to it as Ragnarøkkr, 'Twilight of the Gods.' The event was also occasionally referred to as aldar rök, 
                   &#10; 'fate of mankind,' and a host of other names."
